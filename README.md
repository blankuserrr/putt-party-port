# Putt Party Port
An early experiment in porting the Discord-only game Putt Party to the web by **proxying requests back to discord's servers. bypassing almost every issue that the emulator has, even including name selection/multiplayer.** An alternative to emulation.

## Issues
- Loading: Takes a bit to load initially, sometimes it *fails to load into maps*.
- Still no profile customization other than username.
- ROOMS: See `SERVER.md`.
- Should be more options than just downloading as you play onto a server.
- Less flexibility than emulation: Features like custom maps/game modes are harder with the proxy, may require interception/dynamic rewriting

TODO: Finish this
